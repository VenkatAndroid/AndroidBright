Hence, the length of the period is exactly 365 days (equal to the length of a normal year). Now, dividing 365 by 7 (the number of days in a week) yields a quotient of 52 and a remainder of 1. Hence, the exact length of the period is 52 weeks and one day. Hence, the day February 28 of the year 2000 would advance by one day over the date February 28 of the year 1999.

      "solution": " The period March 11, 2003 through March 11, 2004, not including the former date, includes the complete month of February 2004. So, the length of the period is 366 days (equal to the length of a leap year). The number 366 has a quotient of 52 and a remainder of 2 when divided by 7. Hence, the length of the period is 52 weeks and 2 days. So, the date March 11, 2004 is 2 days advanced over the date March 11, 2003, which is given to be a Tuesday. The second day after a Tuesday is a Thursday. Hence, March 11, 2004 is a Thursday. The answer is (D).",
