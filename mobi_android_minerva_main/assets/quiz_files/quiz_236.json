No two objects in the set are indistinguishable. Hence, the base set does not have any indistinguishable objects.Repetitions of numbers in the safe code are possible.

Hence, order is not important. Now, count the combinations.Since the numbers in the base set (9 numbers) are different, the base set does not have indistinguishable objects.Six of the 9 different numbers are selected by the lottery system, so no repetitions are allowed.By Formula 3, the formula for combinations with no repetitions and no indistinguishable objects, the number of possible selections by the lottery system is \u003csub class\u003d\"frac\"\u003e9\u003c/sub\u003e\u003cem\u003eC\u003c/em\u003e\u003csub class\u003d\"frac\"\u003e6\u003c/sub\u003e.Since only one winning ticket (winning combination) exists per lottery system, there is of \u003csub class\u003d\"frac\"\u003e9\u003c/sub\u003e\u003cem\u003eC\u003c/em\u003e\u003csub class\u003d\"frac\"\u003e6\u003c/sub\u003e tickets per lottery system.
